description: 'His chief amusement was to picture to himself that world which he had
  never seen, to place himself in various conditions, to be entangled in imaginary
  difficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures... The other great book by the
  man who wrote the dictionary: THis is Dr. Johnson''s beautiful, engaging, and ultimately
  inspiring story of a royal brother and sister who escape the castle and, traveling
  in disguise, search for a way to feel more useful to society. It leads to a years-long
  adventure amongst poor people and rich men, great intellectuals and merchants, holy
  men and ruthless warriors. It is an eye-opening experience that shakes the siblings
  to their core and ultimately turns into the most sublimely wise and moving works
  that Johnson ever wrote, not to mention a masterpiece of English literature.'
